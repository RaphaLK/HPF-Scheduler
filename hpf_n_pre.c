/*****
 * Highest Priority First with Non-Preemptive Scheduling 
 * 
 * Project Steps:
 * - Run algorithm for 100 quanta, labeled 0 - 99. Before each run, we want to 
 * generate a set of simulated processes. Each process will have a randomly generated:
 *    - Arrival time: A float value from 0 - 99
 *    - Expected total run time: float from 0.1 - 10 quanta
 *    - A priority from 1 - 4, where 1 is the highest
 *
